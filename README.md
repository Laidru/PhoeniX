My Personal Repository 

# intro
Hiiii
My name is Fabian and I am new to Github!
I joined the community something around 2023

# Interests
I like to code in the Backend.
I am learning Java, MySQL and Javascript at my school. I also know some basic stuff in C#

# Hobbys
One of my hobbies is of course programming. I also have two repositories I contributed something to.
One is a Trading Card Game and the other is a Casino. I stopped both of them because I had to concentrate for school.
